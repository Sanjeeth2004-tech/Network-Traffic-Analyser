# Network Traffic Analyzer (Java)

A Network Traffic Analyzer is a Java-based application designed to capture, monitor, and analyze network traffic in real time. The project helps in understanding packet-level communication, protocol behavior, and traffic patterns within a network.

This project is developed as part of the **Computer Networks domain**, focusing on the practical application of networking concepts using Java.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Network Traffic Analyzer captures network packets and extracts useful information such as source address, destination address, protocol type, packet length, and time of capture. The analyzed data helps in monitoring network performance and understanding how data flows across a network.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Capture live network traffic
- Analyze packet-level information
- Identify network protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
- Monitor traffic patterns
- Understand real-time data transmission
- Support learning of core networking concepts
